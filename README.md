<h1>ItiBoot</h1>

I was previously using Twitter Bootstrap, but after some time finding a few problems with it. However I did like the idea of having a simple, packaged setup to use as a base for web projects. So here's my attempt for <a href="http://www.itio.se">Itios</a> web projects.

Feel free to try it out and improve!
