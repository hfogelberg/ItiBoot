<h1>ItiBoot</h1>

I was previously using Twitter Bootstrap, but after some time finding a few problems with it. 
1) Many sites look too similar.
2) Overriding Bootstraps style requires a bit of work and digging.
3) Sometimes it causes problems with rails.

However I did like the idea of having a simple, packaged setup to use as a base for web projects. So here's my attempt for <a href="http://www.itio.se">Itios</a> web projects.

Note: this is version 0.1 :-)

Feel free to try it out and improve!
